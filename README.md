# pollenTaxaClimateAnalysis

This GitHub repository is a project developed by Derek Kober as part of his Honors Thesis for the University of Utah Honors College. The project is called "pollenTaxaClimateAnalysis" and involves using R code to analyze the relationship between pollen taxa and climate variables in the continental United States. Specifically, the project focuses on exploring the associations between anthropogenic climate change and pollen season trends of various taxa.

Derek Kober is the principal researcher for this project, and the project is intended to contribute to his Honors Thesis. The R code used in the project is shared in the repository, and it provides a detailed account of the methodology used for analyzing the relationship between pollen taxa and climate variables.

The data used in this project was collected by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology's (AAAAI) National Allergy Bureau (NAB) and was provided for this research. It is important to note that the data is not for my distribution and is not included in the repository. While the data used is not shared due to its proprietary nature, the repository provides valuable insights into the methodology and results of the analysis, which could be of interest to other researchers in the field.
