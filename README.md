# pollenTaxaClimateAnalysis
A project that involves R code for analyzing the relationship between pollen taxa and climate variables. 
This project is for my Honors Thesis for the University of Utah Honors College titled "Associations between Anthropogenic climate change and pollen season trends of various taxa in the continental United States."
I, Derek Kober, am the prinicple researcher. 
The data used was given to me from NAB and is not for me to distribute.
